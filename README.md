# Weather Dashboard

## Description

In this project I created a application that allows travelers to search their destinations (cities) and view the current weather in that city while also generating a 5 day forecast. After searching a for a city the user can see a search history allowing them to click on the history to review the weather for the specidfied locations. Also another feature I added allows the user to reload the page on their last searched location.

## Questions

## Motivation

My motivation was to create a simple application that would make it easy to plan a trip out for a minimum of five days allowing users to store
the search history and easily access previously searched locations. I wanted a clean looking application but still an inviting aesthetic.

## Reason

I built this application to grow my skills in javascript and develop my knowledge in problmen solving. 
I used a number of resources to explore various ways of solving problems through this project.

## Problems

I ran into a number of problems that took me a while to solve such as how to create a loop for the weather to be displayed on each card for the next day.
I solve this through online resources and videos and trial and error.

## Learning

I learned how to set <p> in javascript which I was not entirely aware of and sort of discovered it by accident. 
I also learned how to ad an event listender to a key such as 'enter.'
The biggest problem that I learned from in this project was building the for loop.
It by far required the most amount of energy from me in this project. 
Another fun feature that I learned about was adding the 'unit swtitcher' which allows the user to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

## Standout

I am not sure that at my skill level my project stands out per say, however I think I wrote code in a way that pushed my understanding of javascript and logical structure. I also feel like I have a more genuine understanding of the javascript structure.
